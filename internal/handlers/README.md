# Handlers

## Enchancments
- Add README to each handler directory to outline the following:
1. Introduction
2. Request (this should include the URL and Body)
3. Response
4. How to manually trigger the handler from environment
- I didn't get time to add the README but some of the above information is also available in the [API Swagger](../../api/swagger.yaml)
