# Scripts

## Enhancements 

### Choas Testing
- If I had time, I would have created a script which would create lots of requests to the application and in parallel. The requests should be a mixture of getting data and updating data in the database.
- This should create a huge load to the application and the underlying infrastructure. With this script, I would be able to examine how the infrastructure and application copes when under stress.
- With the results, improvements can be made so that the system can scale and cope more efficiently. This is important as we need to think ahead of how the system will cope when more customers are involved with the company.
